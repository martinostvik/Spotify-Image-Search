A react and express application for searching for artist on spotify by face recognition.

## Getting Started

Follow steps below to get project set up.

### API Keys

Make sure you have a client id and client secret at [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) .
You also need a api key at [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) .
These API keys should be stored as envirement variables in a .env file in server root foler. (see .env.example for example)

```
CLARIFY_API_KEY = YOUR_KEY
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = YOUR_KEY
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = YOUR_KEY
```

### Node modules

Install node modules to get dependencies and launch application.

Enter these commands in the terminal

```
cd server && npm i
```

The same for client

```
cd client && npm i
```

Now you have the dependencies and project is ready for being launched in developmentt mode.
